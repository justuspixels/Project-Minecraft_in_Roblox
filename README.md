# Project-Minecraft_in_Roblox
Project MiR is a community driven project for recreating Minecraft in Roblox. we are looking for script submissions, ideas, and feedback. Join the project by contributing in one way or another! I am inspired by the infdev and alpha phases of Minecraft's development, and so thats what we will be making in terms of MiR. This will of course be written in Roblox-Lua so if you are submitting code make sure to test it in roblox studio!
